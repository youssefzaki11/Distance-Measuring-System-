Description: 
The Project is implemented to measure the distance by using the timer value calculated by the pulse generated from the Ultrasonic Sensor. The Project has been implemented using
layered architecture model. 
Objective: Displaying the measuring distance on the 4x16 LCD 
Drivers: GPIO - LCD - Input Capture Unit (ICU) - Ultrasonic Sensor
Microcontroller: AVR AtMega32
